# Misery
Misery is a modular Windows-based research project designed to simulate a high-speed ransomware infection by blending sophisticated evasion techniques with professional-grade encryption. Utilizing multi-threaded AES-256-CBC encryption to rapidly lock files while simultaneously blinding OS security features like AMSI and ETW to remain undetected. By systematically destroying backup shadows, elevating its own privileges, and establishing multi-layered persistence through registry hijacks and accessibility backdoors, Misery demonstrates how a modern payload can weaponize legitimate Windows internals to achieve total system dominance before self-deleting to frustrate forensic recovery.
